# MNIST-pytorch

A basic convolutional neural network trained on MNIST handwritten digits. This repository consists of 3 files:

- `model.py`: Contains two classes, `Net` and `Net2`, which are convolutional neural networks used to train on the MNIST Dataset.
- `utils.py`: Contains 3 functions: `train` for training the convolutional neural networks, `test` for testing the convolutional neural networks, and `GetCorrectPredCount` to evaluate the test predictions with the original labels.
- `s5.ipynb`: Contains code used to train the MNIST data on `Net` and `Net2` architectures.
